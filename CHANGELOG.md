# reStrainingOrder Changelog

## Changelog for version 0.2.0

- Fixed the allele-ratio plot/table in the HTML report (it was picking these ratios in a rather random manner). Adressed in [#1](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/reStrainingOrder/issues/1). 

## Changelog for reStrainingOrder v0.1.0

- Initial release. All basic tools seem to be working. Documentation and help need a little more work, but this will have to wait until after the holidays.

- Travis CI also needs some TLC (read: there are currently no use useful checks being carried out).
