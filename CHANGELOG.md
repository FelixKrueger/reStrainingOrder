# reStrainingOrder Changelog

## Changelog for reStrainingOrder v0.1.0

Initial release. All basic tools seem to be working. Documentation and help need a little more work, but this will have to wait until after the holidays.

Travis CI also needs some TLC (read: there are currently no use useful checks being carried out).
